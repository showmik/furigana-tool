# Furigana Tool
**Furigana Tool** automates the process of writing HTML code for Furigana in *[ruby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby)* syntax. It uses a modified version of the **[Gem](https://github.com/helephant/Gem)** library and adds a User Interface to it.

This tool was intended to be used along with the **[HTML Table Generator](https://github.com/showmik/html-table-generator)** for one of my projects.
